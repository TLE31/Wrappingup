# Wrapping Up: Real-Time Object Detection for Packaging Automation

## Overview

Wrapping Up is a cutting-edge web application designed to enhance packaging efficiency by automating the classification of products and dynamically suggesting optimal packaging materials. Built with React.js and TensorFlow.js, this project leverages a fine-tuned COCO-SSD model to deliver precise, real-time object detection.

## Features

- **Real-Time Object Detection:** The application integrates a fine-tuned COCO-SSD model, capable of detecting and classifying objects in real-time with high accuracy.
- **Automated Packaging Recommendations:** Based on the detected object, the system dynamically suggests suitable packaging materials, streamlining the packaging process.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Developed with React.js, the interface is intuitive, ensuring ease of use while providing powerful functionalities.
- **Optimized Performance:** Leveraging TensorFlow.js, the model is optimized for speed and accuracy, reducing the need for manual intervention in packaging workflows.

## Technical Details

- **Model Fine-Tuning:** The COCO-SSD model was fine-tuned using transfer learning on a custom dataset of 10,000+ images, specifically curated for packaging automation tasks.
- **Frameworks and Libraries:** The project is developed using React.js for the front-end, TensorFlow.js for model integration, and COCO-SSD for object detection.
- **Deployment:** The application is designed to be easily deployable on web platforms, ensuring accessibility and scalability.
